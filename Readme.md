# Tic Tac Toe Game in Java
- A classic Tic Tac Toe implementation in Java, featuring a console-based interface with player-vs-player logic. This project demonstrates core Java concepts like 2D arrays, loops, and conditional statements.

# Features
- Player vs Player: Two players take turns to mark X or O on a 3x3 grid.
- Simple UI: Clean console-based interface with numbered grid positions.
- Input Validation: Prevents invalid moves (e.g., overwriting occupied cells).

# Technologies Used
- Java: Core logic and console interaction.
- No external dependencies: Pure Java (no libraries/frameworks needed).
